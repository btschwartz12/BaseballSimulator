# BaseballSimulator

### By: Ben Schwartz

BaseballSimulator is a C++ high school project that is designed to scrape data from baseball reference databases and simulate baseball games. This was my first experience with object-oriented programming and is intended to be a learning experience. 

Although the project is unfinished, it contains some basic functionality and demonstrates an understanding of basic OOP principles. This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. 

To use BaseballSimulator, please clone the repository and compile the code in your C++ development environment. Since this project is incomplete, we cannot guarantee full functionality or support.
