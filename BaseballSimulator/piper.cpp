// be able to either simulate 1 game or millions of games, see tendencies after games
// allow user to enter player stats
// have a true average, then lower it if they are in a slump and vice versa (can average the true vs actual and use that for randomization)
// seperate averages for how they actually perform
//make a function for error catching?????
//might be easier to use friend functions idk tho
//the player class does not need to store atBats, but I think it would be cool if it did
// graphics?

//destruct everything
